# Cyber-Security

This repository is the main repository for the Cyber Security Team. Whilst general files should go here, full projects within the Cyber Security team should be split-off into their own repository within the Redback Operations company (under the Cyber team, ensure Tutors have **admin** and cyber team **write** permissions) to avoid bloat in this central repository.


- Research folder contains generic research not relevant to a particular trimester.

- Otherwise, each trimester folder contains small projects / trials conducted.

- Documentation links for associated docs are scattered were relevant documentation exists. 

- Some 2022 files yet to be moved over.

- If you are creating documentation or a research piece, please create a .md equivalent and add to the [documentation repo](https://github.com/Redback-Operations/redback-documentation)
